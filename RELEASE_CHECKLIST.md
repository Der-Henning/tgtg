# Release Checklist

Since I always forget something when I create a new release, here is a small checklist for my future me.

1. Read this checklist.
2. Make sure all tests are passing.
3. Do some manual testing.
4. Make sure everything that should be merged is merged. (Dependency updates?)
5. Update Version in `./src/_version.py`.
6. Update Version and Dockerfile links in `./DOCKER_README.md`.
7. Check if the readme file needs to be adjusted.
